# Facial Recognition & Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

This work pretends to build a python script to detect a person's face within a subset of 8 different people.\
To do this, we used **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** with **Singular Value Decomposition(SVD)** to reduce the size the dimensionality of the dataset preserving at least 90% of the data.\
Additionally, we attach arbitrary faces the problem to evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithm.

The data used in this work is here:
