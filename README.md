# Facial Recognition & Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

This work present a python script to detect a person's face within a subset of 8 different people.\

To do this, we used **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** with **Singular Value Decomposition(SVD)** to reduce the size the dimensionality of the dataset preserving at least 90% of the data.

Additionally, we attach arbitrary faces the problem to evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithm.
